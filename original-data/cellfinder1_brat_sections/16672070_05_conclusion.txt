In summary, the Illumina bead array has several key strengths including high throughput, low cost and high sensitivity. By using this array, we can readily detect contaminating feeders and spontaneous differentiation, differentiate male and female lines and distinguish between one undifferentiated population and another. Such a global analysis allows us to assess context dependent signaling and identify biomarkers of particular states of cells. Our future efforts will focus on data mining and developing better cross platform comparison tools and generating focused high throughput arrays for quality control in clinical and research settings.
