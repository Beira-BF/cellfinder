Cloning and expression of Brachyury, DPPA5, CD9, E-Cadherin, GATA1, GATA6, Nanog, Oct3/4, PDX-1, PODXL, SOX2 and SOX17Brachyury (aa. 1–202), DPPA5 (a.a. 1–116), GATA1 (a.a. 1–413), GATA6 (aa. 1–449), Nanog (aa. 153–305), Oct3/4 (aa. 1–265), PDX-1 (aa. 1–283), SOX2 (aa. 135–317) and SOX17 (aa. 177–414) were expressed in E. Coli and extracellular domains of CD9, E-Cadherin, PODXL were expressed in mouse NSO cells. All proteins were purified and sequenced before they were used as antigens for immunizations and as substrate for antibody screening and subcloning. Production and purification of antibodiesAll monoclonal antibodies were derived from fusions of mouse myeloma with B cells obtained from BALB/c mice which had been immunized with purified antigen. The IgG fraction of the culture supernatant was purified by Protein G affinity chromatography (Sigma). Each panel of antibodies was screened and selected for their abilities to detect purified recombinant antigen in direct ELISA and Western blot. All polyclonal antibodies were derived from sera of goats which had been immunized and boost it with purified antigen. Antibody was purified from the sera by an antigen-affinity chromatography. Cells and cell cultureHuman Caco-2, MG-63, MCF-7, NTERA-2 and mouse D3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured according to the ATCC instructions. Information regarding human ES cell line HSF-6 (NIH code UC06) can be obtained at the website [14]. Undifferentiated human ES cells were cultured according to the protocol provided by the University of California, San Francisco in human ES culture medium [DMEM supplemented with 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Invitrogen) and 5 ng/mL of bFGF (R&D Systems)]. To induce formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), ES colonies were harvested, separated from the MEF feeder cells by gravity, gently resuspended in ES culture medium and transferred to non-adherent suspension culture dishes (Corning). Unless otherwise noted, EBs derived from human ES cell aggregates were cultured for 8 days in ES culture medium deprived of bFGF and used for analysis by immunohistochemistry as described. Western blotCells are solubilized in hot 2× SDS gel sample buffer (20 mM dithiothreitol, 6% SDS, 0.25 M Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10 mM NaF and bromophenyl blue) at 2 × 106 per mL. The extracts are heated in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes and sonicated with a probe sonicator with 3–4 bursts of 5–10 seconds each. Samples are diluted with 1× SDS sample buffer to the desired loading of 1–5 × 103 per lane. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and immunoblotted with 0.5 μg/mL primary Abs as described in R&D Systems Website [15]. ImmunohistochemistryAntibodies were used with the appropriate secondary reagents at a concentration of 5 to 10 μg/ml. Cells or sections of EBs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min, then blocked and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, 10% normal donkey serum in PBS at room temperature for 45 min. After blocking, cells were incubated with diluted primary antibody overnight at 4°C followed by coupled anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes) at room temperature in the dark for an hour. Between each step cells were washed with PBS with 0.1% BSA. RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from EBs using Trizol LS (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR primers are available upon request. Flow cytometryAntibodies were prepared at the concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. 10 μL of the stock solution was added to 1 – 2.5 × 105 cells in a total reaction volume not exceeding 200 μL. The sample was then incubated for 20 min at 2–8 °C. Following incubation, excess antibody was removed by washing cells twice with FACS buffer (2% FCS and 0.1% sodium azide in Hank's buffer). After wash, cells were resuspend in 200 μL of FACS buffer and the binding of unlabeled monoclonal antibodies was visualized by adding 10 μL of a 25 μg/mL stock solution of a secondary developing reagent such as goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to a fluorochrome for 20 min at 2–8°C. Following incubation, cells were washed once with FACS buffer, once with PBS. After wash, cells were resuspend in 400 μL of PBS and analyzed on a FACScant flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Five thousand events were collected and analyzed using CELL Quest software.
