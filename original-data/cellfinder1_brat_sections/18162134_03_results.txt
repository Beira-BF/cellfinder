PowerBlot analysis of hESCsWe first employed a large-scale western blot screen, the PowerBlot system, to profile protein expression in undifferentiated hESCs. This system used 934 antibodies toward proteins representing 22 diverse classes of function, such as transcription factors, the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway, and apoptosis, among others. To expand a large-scale culture of BG01 cells for this assay, a collagenase- and trypsin- based passaging method was used [23]. While these conditions have been associated with the accumulation of trisomies of chromosomes 12, 17 and X [24], the ease of use of these cultures and similarity in gene expression and differentiation potential to karyotypically normal BG01 hESCs [11,24,25] make them suitable for such large scale applications. For the PowerBlot screen, whole cell lysate from BG01 hESCs was separated on five 4–15% gradient gels. Each blot contained size markers and 39 lanes. Each lane was screened with 1–8 antibodies in combinations that had been predetermined to enable accurate identification of well-separated proteins (Fig. 1A–E). The gels and blots were performed in duplicate and expressed proteins were identified by their predicted size and verified by visual inspection.Figure 1PowerBlot analysis of undifferentiated BG01 hESCs. This large-scale western blot consisted of five gels run in duplicate and probed with 934 antibodies. (A-E) One set of blots is shown at a contrast that highlights most bands. (F) A representative lane (gel C, lane 24) aligned with protein markers used for band identification. (G) Scatter-plot of the normalized average intensity (i.u.) values for each protein indicating a linear relationship between duplicate blots. Datasets for this analysis are in Additional Tables 1 and 2.A total of 545 antibodies detected bands of appropriate size, which could be compressed to 529 proteins with unique SwissProt identification numbers (Fig. 1A–E and Additional File 1). An enlargement of a representative lane (lane 24 of Blot C) alongside protein markers is shown in Fig. 1F. Thirteen proteins including AKT, caveolin1 and ERK1 were detected in multiple lanes using the same or different antibodies. Information on the antibody catalogue number and dilution, band intensity for each repeat and the averaged value, description of protein function, and Entrez gene and SwissProt database identification numbers is shown in Additional File 1. Three hundred and eighty three antibodies did not detect bands in this screen, indicating lack of expression, or possibly technical issues with detection under standard conditions (Additional File 1).The size of the detected proteins ranged from 15 kD (GS15) to 280 kD (ABP-280). The average intensity of the detected proteins ranged from 195 to 117926 normalized intensity units (i.u.), with an average of 5367 i.u. The proteins with the highest band intensity were the B2 Bradykinin Receptor (117926 i.u.), Karyopherin α (80698 i.u.), and BiP (74922 i.u.), whilst the proteins with the lowest intensity that could be verified by visual inspection were Inhibitor 2 (247 i.u.), Caspase 8 (201 i.u.), and OXA1Hs (195 i.u.). Finally, the consistency of this assay was demonstrated by plotting the normalized average intensity values for each protein, which revealed a linear relationship between the duplicate samples (Fig. 1G). Kinexus analysis of hESCsA more focused screen was used to profile expression of protein kinases, phosphatases and phosphorylated sites in cell signaling molecules in hESCs. The Kinexus assays contained 140 antibodies to these related classes of proteins and phospho-sites. Karyotypically normal BG03 hESCs grown on a fibronectin matrix in MEF-CM [26] were used for this analysis, and whole cell lysate was separated on four 12.5% gels for western blotting. Eighty five immunoreactive bands were identified, representing 38 protein kinases and 16 phosphatases, their isoforms, and 22 phosphorylated sites in signaling molecules (Fig. 2A–D, Additional File 1). Sixty-four antibodies did not detect their corresponding antigen (Additional File 1).Figure 2Kinexus blots of undifferentiated BG03 cells. Four blots were used to probe BG03 lysate with (A, B) 76 antibodies for protein kinases, (C) 27 antibodies for phosphatases and (D) 37 antibodies for phosphoylated sites in cell signaling molecules. Identified bands are indicated (*). Datasets for this analysis are in Additional Tables 1 and 2. Functional classification of proteins expressed in hESCsThe PowerBlot and Kinexus assays identified a diverse range of proteins expressed in hESCs. To further annotate these data, the detected proteins were ordered into 18 subgroups based on protein function (Additional File 2). For example, 16 factors with known or implied roles in the regulation of self-renewal or pluripotency of mESCs or hESCs, such as Oct4 [27], STAT3 [28], members of the FGF [29], PI3 kinase [30], Src [31] or MAPK pathways [32], and phosphorylated isoforms of GSK3, STAT3 and p38 MAPK, were grouped under "Pluripotency" (Fig. 3A and Additional File 2). Another functional group (Cell surface) consisted of 20 transmembrane or cell surface proteins (Additional File 2). This included several receptors for peptides and growth factors, such as neurotensin receptor 3, the B2 bradykinin, endothelin 1, and thrombin receptors, and the glial derived neurotrophic factor receptor α (Fig. 3B). These molecules may be useful as targets for cell sorting experiments, and expression of these receptors could identify bioactive peptides or growth factors that may influence hESC self-renewal or differentiation.Figure 3Functional classification and mobility variants of proteins detected in hESCs. (A) Proteins with known or suggested roles in self-renewal are shown, including Oct4, STAT3, Smad2/3 and FGF2 (Additional Table 2, "Pluripotency"). Isoforms of FGF2, and phospho-GSK3 are indicated (*). (B) Cell surface proteins are shown, including Connexin 43, E-Cad and GDNFRα (Additional Table 2, "Cell Surface"). Other functional classes of proteins are indicated in Additional Table 2. (C) A total of 42 proteins, including FGF2, HSP70 and ERK1, were found to have multiple bands in either the PowerBlot or Kinexus blots. These bands migrated closely but were sufficiently separated from other detected proteins. Bands predicted to be isoforms of the indicated protein are highlighted in some panels (*).Other functional classification of the proteins detected by the PowerBlot screen included: transcription factors (71 proteins), nucleus and nuclear transport (144), cytoskeleton (75), cell adhesion (45), MAP kinase pathway (24), protein kinase A (13), protein kinase C (20), tyrosine kinases (15), adaptors and tyrosine kinase substrates (51), protein phosphatases (17), GTPases and regulators (42), calcium signaling (23), cell cycle (87), apoptosis (61), membrane research (62), and other functions (51) (Additional File 1). Some proteins were included in multiple functional categories due to overlapping properties, such as AIM-1, which was included in the cell cycle as well as in the nucleus/nuclear transport categories. The Kinexus expression data was organized separately into cell signaling-related functional groups (Additional File 1). In addition, 35 proteins were detected by both the PowerBlot and Kinexus systems (Table 1).Table 1Proteins detected by both PowerBlot and Kinexus systemsProtein nameSwiss NrProtein nameSwiss NrBMXP51813MEK2P36506CaM Kinase KinaseQ64572MKP2Q62767Casein Kinase I epsilonP49674p38 alpha/SAPK2aQ16539Casein Kinase II alpha/CK2aP19139PaxillinP49024Cdk1/Cdc2P06493PKA CP17612Cdk5Q00535PKC betaP05771Cdk7P50613PKC deltaQ05655DAP KinaseP53355PP2A Catalytic alphaP05323DAP3P51398PP5/PPTP53042ERK1Q63538PTP1BP18031ERK2P27703PTP1C/SHP1P29350FAKQ00944PTP1D/SHP2Q06124GSK-3 betaP18266RbP13405I kappa B alphaP25963RskQ15418IKK betaO14920Stat1A46159JAK1P23458Stat3P52631JNK1P45983VHRP51452MEK1Q02750 Detection of protein isoforms or post-translational variantsUnlike many cDNA-based gene expression assays, western blotting has the capacity to detect multiple protein isoforms due to translation of different mRNA splice variants, as well as post-translational modifications such as enzymatic cleavage, glycosylation, or phosphorylation. Examination of the blots described here identified 42 examples of multiple banding for a single target antigen (Fig. 3C). These candidates exhibited closely migrating multiple bands, which were close to their predicted size but were sufficiently separated from other proteins. For example, four closely migrating bands were observed for FGF2 (Fig. 3C, top panel), which may represent known glycosylation variants of this growth factor [33]. Other known examples of post-translational modifications included those of HSP70, IKKgamma and ERK1. Verification of protein expression by immunocytochemistryThe PowerBlot and Kinexus assays identified proteins based on their expected and observed molecular weight, using combinations of antibodies that had been predetermined to detect proteins of sufficiently different sizes. Proteins known to be expressed by hESCs and also identified by these assays, included Oct4, E-CAD, Connexin 43 and Hsp70. To verify expression using a complementary approach, we performed immunoflurorescent staining for 10 proteins not previously reported to be expressed in hESCs by immunocytochemistry, using karyotypically normal BG01 cultures (Fig. 4A–K). These included ABP-280, a homodimeric actin-binding protein often associated with membrane glycoproteins; CtBP1 and CtBP2, two C terminal binding proteins that are a class of transcription corepressors; GS-28, a golgi protein; HDJ-2, a member of the DnaJ-related Hsp40 (heat shock protein 40) subfamily; L-Caldesmon, a cytoplasmic actin-binding protein; Rabaptin, a GTP-binding protein; phosphorylated-p130 Cas, a docking protein with an amino-terminal SH3 domain that may function as a molecular switch that regulates CAS (Crk-associated substrate) tyrosine phosphorylation; Ras-GAP and phosphorylated Ras-GAP (p-Y460), a protein that down-regulates the signal transducer p21ras; and ShcC, a protein with an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain. These proteins were all expressed by hESCs, with the expected subcellular localization (Fig. 4A–K). Oct4 was used as a positive control (Fig. 4L). These results suggested that most of the bands in the PowerBlot and Kinexus assays were likely to be correctly identified.Figure 4Verification of protein expression using immunocytochemistry. (A-K) Ten proteins that were detected in undifferentiated hESCs by western blotting were also detected by immunofluorescence of BG01 cells grown in MEF-CM. Ras-GAP (pY460) is a phosphorylated form of Ras-GAP. The same antibodies were used in this analysis as in the PowerBlot assay, except phospho-p130 Cas (Tyr165). (L) Oct4 was used as a positive control. (M-R) Oct4, TNIK and p130 Cas as markers of undifferentiated hESCs. BG01 cultures were partially differentiated by exposure to 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 days. (M) Oct4 was expressed uniformly in undifferentiated cells, (P) but was downregulated in morphologically differentiated areas after 3 days in serum (arrowhead). (N) TNIK expression was localized to the cytoplasm, and (N, Q) expression appeared to be restricted to morphologically undifferentiated cells (arrowhead). (O) p130 Cas was detected in a membrane/peripheral-cytoplasmic pattern in undifferentiated cells, (R) but this distribution was substantially altered in differentiating cells with a flattened morphology, which exhibited a general cytoplasmic, or perinuclear profile. Scale bar for A-L: (A, L) 200 μm; (C, D, F, H, I, J, K) 100 μm; (B, E, G) 50 μm. Scale bar for M-R: (M, N, P, Q): 100 μm ; (O, R): 50 μm.Preliminary analyses also indicated that expression of some of these proteins was downregulated in differentiated cells, including p130 Cas and the Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK). TNIK is known to be involved in the inhibition of cell spreading via disruption of F-actin [34,35]. Immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression of TNIK and p130 Cas during early differentiation of hESCs. BG01 cultures were partially differentiated by growth in serum containing media for 3 days. This condition generated heterogeneous populations containing Oct4+ cells with characteristic hESC morphology and less tightly packed, and morphologically differentiated areas, lacking expression of Oct4 (Fig 4M, P). TNIK was expressed highly in undifferentiated hESCs, and in the undifferentiated areas at day 3, but was downregulated in areas undergoing morphological differentiation (Fig 4N, Q). This may indicate that TNIK is active in hESCs and degraded rapidly upon differentiation. p130 Cas was detected in a membrane/peripheral-cytoplasmic pattern in hESCs (Fig 4O). The distribution of p130Cas was substantially altered in differentiating cells with a flattened morphology, exhibiting a general cytoplasmic, or perinuclear profile (Fig 4R). This could indicate an alteration in the function of p130 Cas as pluripotent cells differentiate. These analyses suggested that the change in expression or distribution of these proteins could be used as markers for undifferentiated hESCs. Comparison of proteomic and transcriptional profiles of hESCsWe have previously employed the Illumina Bead Array system for the large-scale profiling of gene expression in hESCs using 24,000 transcript probes [11]. To compare proteomic and transcriptional analyses of hESCs, the levels of > 600 proteins detected using large scale blotting were correlated with the levels of transcripts detected with the Illumina platform (Additional File 3). In general, a close match between the expression level of transcript and protein was observed: transcripts for nearly all the detected proteins were also identified in the Illumina analysis, and most proteins expressed at high levels also exhibited high mRNA levels.We reasoned that a focused comparison of specific signaling pathways using a combination of proteomic and transcriptional data was likely to be much more informative than a global interrogation of hESCs. Several major signal pathways that have been suggested to be involved in self-renewal were examined to test this approach. These included the FGF, TGFβ, GSK3β/Wnt/β-catenin and Jak/Stat pathways [17,29,36-39], as well as the more recently suggested MAPK/ERK and Gap junction pathways [32,40]. Correlating transcriptional and proteomic data provided direct confirmation that these pathways were present and likely functional in hESCs (Table 2). For example, FGF2 protein was expressed highly in hESCs and expression of key members of the TGFβ, Wnt, Jak/Stat and Gap junction pathways, namely Stat1, SMADs, GSK3β, β-catenin and Connexin 43, were detected in both transcriptional and proteomic databases.Table 2Signal pathways that may be active in hESCsNameProteinmRNATGF βStat1++++++PAI-1/SERPINE1+++-Smad2/3++++Jun+++Smad4/DPC4+++Endoglin+-WntCtBP2+++++++PP2A Catalytic alpha/PPP2CA+++++++EBP50/SLC9A3R1++++++beta-Catenin/Ctnnb1++++Cyclin D3/CCND3++++GSK-3 beta++++Jun+++Casein Kinase II alpha/CSNK2A1++++Jak-StatStat1++++++Crk++++Stat3/2+++++Stat6+++++PTP1B+++++JAK1++-Glucocorticoid R/NR3C1++-Thrombin Receptor/PAR1/F2R+++SHPS-1/PTPNS1++++MCM5+++++Smad2/3++++Tyk2++++Jun+++Bcl-x/BCL2L1++++Smad4/DPC4+++Stat5A++GPCRB2 Bradykinin Receptor/BDKRB2++++-Neurotensin Receptor 3/SORT1+++-Endopeptidase 3.4.24.16/NLN++++IP3R-3++++SHC++++Gap JunctionCdk1/Cdc2++++++GRB2++++++MEK1/MAP2K1++++++PKA C++-PKA RI alpha++-PKC alpha++-C-Raf/RAF1++++ZO-1/TJP1+++++Connexin-43/GJA1++++IGFPKC iota++++++MEK1/MAP2K1++++++Rsk/RPS6KA1+++++GRB2++++++MEK2/MAP2K2++++++PI3Kinase/PIK3R1+++++pan ERK/MAPK1+++++Crk++++eIF-4E+++++ShcC+++-PAI-1/SERPINE1+++-C-Raf++++SHC+++++PKC beta/PRKCB1++++NCK++++PKB alpha/Akt+++GSK-3 beta++++Ercc-1++++Fatty Acid Synthase/FASN+++++Jun+++RAFT1/FRAP++++PTP1D/SHP2/PTPN11++++SCAMP1++++Bcl-x/BCL2L1++++p70s6k/RPS6KB1+-PI3-Kinase p170/PIK3C2A++PTP1B/PTPN1+++Dok1/p62dok+++PI3-Kinase p110 alpha/PIK3CA+-ERBBEphA4/Sek++++-ShcC/SHC3+++-c-erb-B2/ERBB2++++C-Raf/RAF1++++SHC/SHC1+++++GDNFI kappa B epsilon/NFKBIE++++++GRB2++++++MEK2++++++NCK+++++C-Raf++++Ras-GAP/RASA1++++SHC+++++GDNFR-alpha/Gfra1++-Jun+++IKK beta++++pan-JNK/SAPK1/MAPK10+++NBS1/ARTN++Dok1/p62dok+++Tight JunctionPTEN++++++PP2A Catalytic alpha+++++++PKC iota++++++Sec8/SEC8L1+++++beta-Catenin/CTNNB1++++CDC42+++++AF6/MLLT4+++++PKC alpha++-Yes++++Rho/ARHA+++++ZO-1/TJP1+++++CASK+++Symplekin/SYMPK++-Ras/NRAS++++Casein Kinase II alpha/CSNK2A1++++VAP33/VAPA+++alpha-Catenin/Ctnna1+++MAPKpan ERK++++++MEK1++++++Rsk++++++ERK2++++++MEK2/Map2k2++++++MST3/STK25++++++ERK1+++++CDC42+++++C-Raf++++p38 alpha/SAPK2a++-G3BP+++++TFII-I/GTF2IRD1++++MST1/STK4++++MKP2/Dusp4++++Ras++++Phospho-p38MAPK (T180/Y182)+++pan-JNK/SAPK1+++Inhibitor2/PPP1R2++++ABP-280++++++14-3-3 epsilon/YWHAE++++MAPKAPK-5+++TAO1+*PBK+++MKK3b/Map2k3++Protein expression level: > 10,000: ++++; 5,000–10,000: +++; 1,000–5,000:++; 100–1,000: + mRNA gene expression level: > 5,000:++++; 1,000–5,000: +++; 100–1,000: ++; 30–100: +*: not included in the gene expression arrayThis independent confirmation of known networks led us to examine other pathways that showed a similar correlation but have not been identified as key regulators of either self-renewal or differentiation, or suggest unappreciated characteristics of hESCs. Four signaling pathways (IGF, ERBB2, GPCR, and GDNF) and the tight junction complex were highlighted by this analysis (Table 2), and expression of key proteins in these pathways was confirmed. A detailed study demonstrating the importance of the IGF and ERBB2 pathways in hESC self-renewal has been performed and enabled the development of a defined medium for hESC maintenance (TCS and AJR, submitted). Tight junctions are apical cell-cell junctions found in epithelia that establish a barrier to the extracellular environment and a border for apical-basolateral polarity. While hESCs grow in colonies that are highly reminiscent of epithelia, and have been shown to be coupled by gap junctions [40], the formation of tight junction complexes has not been described. hESCs expressed the ZO1 and occludin tight junction proteins along cell borders as expected in polarized epithelia. The distribution of ZO1 expression changed dramatically as hESCs proliferated in culture. When tight junction complexes were disrupted by disaggreagation to single cells, only a subset of cells showed ZO1 staining 4 days after plating (Fig. 5). Continued proliferation to a confluent monolayer on day 7 was accompanied by widespread expression of ZO1, suggesting the formation of a general tight junction barrier. These cultures were undifferentiated and retained uniform expression of Oct4 protein (not shown). ERBB2 and 3 are members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor family, which regulate epithelial proliferation via EGF-family ligands. ERBB2 and 3 transcripts are expressed by hESCs [8], are known to function as a heterodimer [41], and transmit a strong proliferative signal for hESCs by Heregulin 1β (an EGF-family ligand) (TCS and AJR, submitted). Immunofluorescence revealed general cell surface expression of ERBB2 on hESCs. Conversely, ERBB3 was highly localized to a concentrated area, and observed in cells that also expressed ZO1. Epithelial cells are known to localize ERBB receptors to the basolateral side of tight junctions, which serves to functionally separate receptors from ligands [42,43]. This is a basic epithelial wound healing mechanism, whereby disruption of the tight junction barrier by injury immediately exposes receptors to extracelluar ligands [43]. These staining patterns are also suggestive of basolateral sorting of ERBB3 in hESCs. The pathways and complexes identified by these analyses lay a framework for future functional analyses of signaling networks in hESCs.Figure 5Tight junction proteins and ERBB2/3 expression in hESCs.
