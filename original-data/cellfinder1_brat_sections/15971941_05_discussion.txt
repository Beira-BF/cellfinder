Previous studies have demonstrated the derivation of neural cells [1â€“3], hematopoietic [17] and endothelial lineages [18], and cardiomyocytes [19] from hESCs. This study presents the induction of paraxial mesoderm with the generation of multipotent mesenchymal precursors. We calculate that under these conditions a single undifferentiated hESC yields an average of one CD73+ cell at day 40 of differentiation, suggesting a balance between cell proliferation and cell selection. There were no obvious differences in marker and gene-expression profile or in differentiation behavior among the five hESMPC lines generated. However, some of the lines (e.g., hESMPC9.1) exhibited a tendency of spontaneous osteogenic differentiation after long-term propagation. Directed differentiation of hESCs into somatic stem-cell-like precursors represents a substantial advancement in harnessing the developmental potential of hESCs. The high purity, unlimited availability, and multipotentiality of hESMPCs will provide the basis for future therapeutic efforts using these cells in preclinical animal models of disease. Such in vivo studies will also be required to properly assess the safety profile of these cells. Furthermore, our system also offers a novel platform to study basic mechanisms of mesodermal induction and differentiation during early human development.
