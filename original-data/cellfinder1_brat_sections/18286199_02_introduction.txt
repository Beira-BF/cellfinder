To date there have been no effective treatments for improving residual structural and functional deficits resulting from stroke. Current therapeutic approaches, such as the use of thrombolytics, benefit only 1 to 4% of patients [1]. Consequently, the majority of stroke patients experience progression of ischemia associated with debilitating neurological deficits. Recent evidence has suggested that the transplantation of cells derived from cord blood, bone marrow or brain tissue (fetal and adult) enhances sensorimotor function in experimental models of stroke [2], [3]. However, the normal human-derived somatic stem cells used in these studies have a limited capacity to differentiate into the diverse neural cell types optimal for structural and physiological tissue repair and are not amenable for large-scale cell production. Unlike other sources of stem cells, hESC lines possess a nearly unlimited self-renewal capacity and the developmental potential to differentiate into virtually any cell type of the organism. As such, they constitute an ideal source of cells for regenerative medicine. The successful derivation of hESC lines from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos and their long-term maintenance in vitro over multiple passages has been demonstrated [4] and standardized. Differentiation and enrichment processes that direct hESCs towards a neural lineage have also been achieved. To promote neuralization, ESCs were cultured in a defined media supplemented with morphogens or growth factors [5], [6], [7] or cultured under conditions that promote “rosettes”, structures morphologically similar to the developing neural tube [8], [9]. This neuralization process has proven invaluable in understanding the specification of hESC-derived neural tissue [10], [11], [12]. However, the enriched neural progeny derived displayed overgrowth and limited migration after grafting into normal newborn mice [13] and lesioned adult rat striatum [12], [14], [15], [16]. The inner cores of these grafts contained tumorigenic precursor cells (reviewed in [17]). These findings suggest that neural cells generated by acute exposure to growth factors and/or morphogens may still be heterogeneous and potentially tumorigenic. We report an alternative method for the isolation and the perpetuation of a multipotent hNSC line from the hESCs with a primitive mode of self-renewal. We also demonstrate their long-term expansion, non-tumorigenic properties and functional engraftability in an experimental model of stroke.
